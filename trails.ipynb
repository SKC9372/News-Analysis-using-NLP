       "   'content': 'Powerful quantum computers in years not decades, says Microsoft\\n\\n19 February 2025 Share Save Chris Vallance Senior Technology Reporter Share Save\\n\\nMicrosoft\\n\\nMicrosoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\". It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot. Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away. Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced. The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing. But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.\\n\\nJensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years. Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers. \"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\" Travis Humble, director of the Quantum Science Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, said he agreed Microsoft would now be able to deliver prototypes faster - but warned there remained work to do. \"The long term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.\\n\\nWhat is quantum computing?\\n\\nCompanies around the world are racing to make a revolutionary new generation of computers.\\n\\nQuantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today\\'s systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields. There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve. But these are problems quantum machines might be able to rapidly crack, promising new discoveries by creating new medicines or designing better batteries. A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.\\n\\nMicrosoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals. Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor. It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn\\'t a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory. Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.\\n\\nHigh risk, high reward?',\n",

       "   'content': 'Can Trump\\'s tariffs break China\\'s grip on manufacturing?\\n\\n5 March 2025 Share Save Joel Guinto BBC News Reporting from Singapore Share Save\\n\\nGetty Images Trump\\'s tariffs strike at the heart of China\\'s manufacturing juggernaut\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%. This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. Trump\\'s tariffs strike at the heart of China\\'s manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars. China\\'s trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (£788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn). It has long been the world\\'s factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. So how badly could Trump\\'s trade war hurt China\\'s manufacturing success?\\n\\nWhat are tariffs and how do they work?\\n\\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it\\'s generally the importer who pays them. So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.\\n\\nGetty Images Trump\\'s tariffs strike at the heart of China\\'s manufacturing juggernaut\\n\\nIncreasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy\\'s growth. Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers. Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. He also imposed 25% tariffs on America\\'s neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.\\n\\nCan Trump\\'s tariffs hurt China\\'s factories?\\n\\nYes, analysts say. Exports have been the \"saving grace\" of China\\'s economy and if the taxes linger, exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody\\'s analytics, told the BBC. The sheer value of China\\'s exports - which account for a fifth of the country\\'s earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. \"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\" That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption. While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.\\n\\nGetty Images China has been pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)\\n\\n\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said. China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world\\'s second-largest economy. Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered. \"It\\'s really difficult to find a replacement... China\\'s status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"\\n\\nHow is China responding to Trump\\'s tariffs?\\n\\nChina has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars. And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google. China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump\\'s first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs. And yet, Trump\\'s recent tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said. \"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.\\n\\nGetty Images DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT\\n\\nWhat concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China\\'s determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West. It\\'s why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China\\'s access to the most advanced ones. Although this could \"impact China\\'s competitiveness, I don\\'t think that would affect China\\'s status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said. On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will boost its high-value exports.\\n\\nHow did China become a manufacturing superpower?\\n\\nIt happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say. \"The combination of globalisation, as well as China\\'s pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC. The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar. A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.\\n\\nGetty Images It is very difficult to replace China as the world\\'s factory, analysts say',\n",

       "   'content': 'Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy \\'transition\\'\\n\\n10 March 2025 Share Save João da Silva & Natalie Sherman Business reporters, BBC News Share Save\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nA sell-off in the US stock market gathered steam on Monday, fuelled by rising concern about the cost of the trade war to the world\\'s largest economy. The S&P 500, which tracks the biggest American companies, fell about 2% in early trade, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9% and the Nasdaq sank more than 3.5%. The falls came after President Donald Trump ducked questions about whether the US economy was facing a recession or price rises as a result of tariff moves, while warning instead of a \"period of transition\". Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the US, although he acknowledged that the price of some goods may rise.\\n\\nInvestors fear that tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world\\'s largest economy. \"The level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,\" Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors had been optimistic about Trump\\'s plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war. He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets. \"It\\'s a complete change in what the market expected,\" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending amid the uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth. European stocks closed lower on Monday, with France\\'s CAC and the London FTSE indices both closing around 0.9% lower. Germany\\'s DAX closed 1.75% lower. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was because of \"unease around the impact of Trump tariffs\". She added that concerns over the US economy entering a recession is worrying investors. Tesla shares fell about 8% on Monday, while tech stocks Nvidia and Meta were both down more than 4%. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the concerns, responding to a question about whether the US was facing recession: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\\'re doing is very big. We\\'re bringing wealth back to America. That\\'s a big thing.\" \"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" he added.\\n\\nWatch: Trump says tariff exemptions not influenced by the markets\\n\\nThe US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. He imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last week, but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%. The US is now facing retaliation, including new tit-for-tat tariffs from China targeting US farm products that came into effect on Monday. They mean US exports including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans face new tariffs of 10% to 15%. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada\\'s most populous province, also said he was going forward with a 25% surcharge on energy exports to the US, announced in retaliation for the tariffs. If Trump escalates, \"I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,\" he warned.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Is the US really heading into a recession?\\n\\n12 March 2025 Share Save Natalie Sherman BBC News Share Save\\n\\nWatch: Trump doesn\\'t see a recession, saying US will \\'boom\\'\\n\\nDuring his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity. Now two months into his presidency, he\\'s painting a slightly different picture. He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US. Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies. So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world\\'s largest economy?\\n\\nMarkets fall and recession risks rise\\n\\nIn the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes. A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising. A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\\'s Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs. The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.\\n\\nThe market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office. He has hit products from America\\'s three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth. The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however. Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said. Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success. \"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty. The posture has increased investor worries about his plans. Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\". \"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm\\'s analysts warned.\\n\\nTariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth\\n\\nFor many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like. Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending. Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool. \"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It\\'s a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that\\'s what\\'s been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"\\n\\nThe US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\\n\\nSix things that could get more expensive In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening. Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump\\'s election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback. Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households. That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.\\n\\nWatch: How Trump’s stock market rhetoric has shifted over the years\\n\\nThe head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years. \"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said. But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB. \"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.\\n\\nStock market in tech ripe for correction',\n",

       "   'content': 'The slow but steady advance of driverless vehicles\\n\\n2 days ago Share Save Ian Rose Business reporter Share Save\\n\\nWatch: Man trapped in driverless car as it spins in circles\\n\\nMike Johns didn\\'t expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral. To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on. But he got much more attention than he bargained for. Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on. The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch. Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers. \"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking. Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.\\n\\nWaymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem. The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\". Nevertheless, Mr John\\'s experience is not the first time the company has had to take action. Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole. And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .\\n\\nGetty Images Waymo says its cars are better than humans \"at avoiding crashes that result in injuries\"\\n\\nThe road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services. In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise. GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\". In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured. Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple\\'s rumoured self-driving car project was folding. Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020. But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk\\'s Tesla. Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida. So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed? \"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy. He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach. \"They\\'ve come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"\\n\\nSo what\\'s next? Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey. That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans. \"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says. He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing. \"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.\\n\\nIt will be a slow process. \"It\\'s actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker. \"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds. And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns. \"This is only going to happen if we\\'re not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.\\n\\nScania Scania is among several truck makers testing autonomous systems\\n\\nFor those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry. \"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania. \"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu. \"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don\\'t have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains. \"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed. \"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"\\n\\nGetty Images China\\'s Baidu has 500 driverless cars operating in Wuhan\\n\\nTo see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China. In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu. Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers. \"There\\'s definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden\\'s innovation agency Vinnova.',\n",

The book, Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company\\'s global public policy director, includes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years working at Facebook. Facebook\\'s parent company, Meta, says the ruling - which orders her to stop promotions \"to the extent within her control\" - affirms that \"the false and defamatory book should never have been published\". The UK publisher Macmillan says it is \"committed to upholding freedom of speech\" and Ms Wynn-Williams\\' \"right to tell her story\".\\n\\nIt told the BBC that she had been due to do \"extensive media\" in the UK and internationally and \"has been prevented from doing so\". At a hearing on Wednesday at the American Arbitration Association - a neutral third party which resolves disputes out of court - Ms Wynn-Williams was told she must refrain from engaging in or \"amplifying any further disparaging, crucial or otherwise detrimental comments\". All previous disparaging comments \"to the extent within her control\" must also be retracted, the ruling also said. The book is former New Zealand diplomat Ms Wynn-Williams\\' account of joining Facebook in 2011 and watching it grow from a \"front row seat\". Her allegations include that executives had worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in exchange for access to the lucrative market. Meta disputes the allegations contained in the book. Regarding China, it says it is \"no secret we were once interested\" in operating services there. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we\\'d explored.\" Ms Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors - which Meta also denies.

It is \"no secret we were once interested\" in operating services in China, it adds. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we\\'d explored.\" Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg\\'s comments from 2019, when he said: \"We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.\"\\n\\nFacebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges. A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from \"a front row seat\". Now she wants to show some of the \"decision-making and moral compromises\" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as \"many of the people I worked with… are going to be central\" to the introduction of AI. In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook\\'s senior team was like. Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. \"I didn\\'t realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,\" she told us. However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company\\'s close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook\\'s decision-making at the time.\\n\\nEyevine Mark Zuckerberg loves board games, but hates losing - according to Sarah Wynn-Williams\\n\\n\"China is Mark Zuckerberg\\'s white whale,\" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams. The country is the world\\'s biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube. \"It\\'s the one piece on the board game that he hasn\\'t conquered,\" she says. Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens\\' user data. \"He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool… basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,\" she told the BBC. Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook\\'s software worked, but were told it was proprietary information. \"But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,\" she says. \"Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building.\" Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been \"widely reported\" at the time.\\n\\nSarah Wynn-Williams Sarah Wynn-Williams pictured with Mark Zuckerberg (c) and Joel Kaplan, now Meta\\'s chief global affairs officer\\n\\nIn her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made \"misleading statements… in response to Congressional inquiries\" about China. One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was \"not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content\" Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg / Facebook Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg went running around Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square on a visit to China in 2016\\n\\nMost Facebook executives didn\\'t allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. \"They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn\\'t allow them to use the product.\" And yet she says reports from 2017 - that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true. \"The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,\" she alleges. The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert. Ms Wynn-Williams says she \"felt sick\" at the thought and tried to push back, \"although I knew it was futile\". \"They said: \\'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We\\'ve got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.\\'\" Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads.\\n\\nEmma Lynch / BBC Ms Wyn-Williams wants Meta to change as it \"influences so much of our day-to-day life\"\\n\\nOverall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people\\'s safety on social media. \"This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it.\" Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting and had shared updates regarding its approach to creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens. It also said it had introduced \"Teen Accounts\" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens\\' use of the app. As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for \"toxic behaviour\" after she had made \"misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment\". But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta\\'s chief global affairs officer. Meta told us she had been paid by \"anti-Facebook activists\" and she was not a whistleblower. \"Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,\" it said.\\n\\nBloomberg via Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg (l), along with Jeff Bezos (c) and Elon Musk (r), attended the inauguration of President Trump in Washington DC in January',\n",

The new governance protocol said it was \"important that robust debate of the issues at stake does not deteriorate into personal criticism of another person who holds a different point of view.\" It said \"courtesy, respect and civility must be maintained at all times\".
